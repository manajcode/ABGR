# A Beginner's Guide to R
During the Summers and Winters of 2017 and 2018, I read and worked on the exercises within  the book "A Beginner's Guide to R," by Alain F. Zuur, Elena N. Ieno, and Erik H.W.G. Meesters (2009, UseR! series, Springer Publishing)

This repository contains the questions and my solutions to the exercises for chapters one though seven. Note that Chapter 7 is partially completed.

The chapters are:
1. Introduction
2. Getting Data into R
3. Accessing Variables and Managing Subsets of Data
4. Simple Functions
5. An Introduction to Basic Plotting Tools
6. Loops and Functions
7. Graphing Tools

The files within this repository are:

1. ABGR_data: A file containing all of the required text, csv, and excel formatted data sets used by the authors.

2. ABGR.Rproj: the R project file to run and link all code. Please open this file first to begin revising code.

3. ABGR_Solutions.Rmd: An Rmarkdown file that contains the questions and solutions to ABGR. Note this file contains the second iteration of solutions; these solutions will use more modern coding approaches.

4. Solutions.R: A compiled version of all of my original solutions written in 2017 and 2018. I wrote these solutions prior to discovering the tidyverse.
